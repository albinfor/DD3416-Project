# DD3416: Safe Robot Planning and Control - Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for the FDD3416 project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The project focuses on the implementation of HJI backwards reachability

The lab explores how HJI reachability works and where it has shortcomings. On the A level we then also try to address these by using learning.
